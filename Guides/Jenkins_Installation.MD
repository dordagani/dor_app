# Install Jenkins + Ansible + Docker on AWS EC2
Jenkins is a self-contained Java-based program, ready to run out-of-the-box, with packages for Windows, Mac OS X and other Unix-like operating systems. As an extensible automation server, Jenkins can be used as a simple CI server or turned into the continuous delivery hub for any project.


### Prerequisites
1. EC2 Instance 
   - With Internet Access
   - Security Group with Port `8080` open for internet


## Install Jenkins
 You can install jenkins using the rpm or by setting up the repo. We will set up the repo so that we can update it easily in the future.
1. Get the latest version of jenkins from https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/ and install
   ```sh
   yum -y install wget
   sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
   sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
   yum -y install jenkins
   ```

   ### Start Jenkins
   ```sh
   # Start jenkins service
   service jenkins start

   # Setup Jenkins to start at boot,
   chkconfig jenkins on
   ```

   ### Accessing Jenkins
   By default jenkins runs at port `8080`, You can access jenkins at
   ```sh
   http://YOUR-SERVER-PUBLIC-IP:8080
   ```
  #### Configure Jenkins
- The default Username is `admin`
- Grab the default password 
- Password Location:`/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
- `Skip` Plugin Installation; _We can do it later_
- Change admin password
   - `Admin` > `Configure` > `Password`
- Configure `java` path
  - `Manage Jenkins` > `Global Tool Configuration` > `JDK`  
- Create another admin user id

### Test Jenkins Jobs
1. Create “new item”
1. Enter an item name – `My-First-Project`
   - Chose `Freestyle` project
1. Under the Build section
	Execute shell: echo "Welcome to Jenkins Demo"
1. Save your job 
1. Build job
1. Check "console output"

### Install Ansible:
#### on same instance

1. Install python and python-pip
   ```sh
   yum install python
   yum install python-pip
   ```
1. Install ansible using pip check for version
    ```sh
    pip install ansible
   ansible --version
   ```
   
1. Create a user called ansadmin (on Control node and Managed host)  
   ```sh
   useradd ansadmin
   passwd ansadmin
   ```
1. Below command grant sudo access to ansadmin user. But we strongly recommended using "visudo" command if you are aware vi or nano editor.  (on Control node and Managed host)
   ```sh
   echo "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
   ```
   
1. Log in as a ansadmin user on master and generate ssh key (on Control node)
   ```sh 
   ssh-keygen
   ```
1. Copy keys onto all ansible managed hosts (on Control node)
   ```sh 
   ssh-copy-id ansadmin@<target-server>
   ```

1. Ansible server used to create images and store on docker registry. Hence install docker, start docker services and add ansadmin to the docker group. 
   ```sh
   yum install docker
   
   # start docker services 
   service docker start
   # Setup docker to start at boot,
   chkconfig docker on
   
   # add user to docker group 
   usermod -aG docker ansadmin

   ```
1. Create a directory /etc/ansible and create an inventory file called "hosts" add control node and managed hosts IP addresses to it. 
 
### Validation test

   
1. Run ansible command as ansadmin user it should be successful (Master)
   ```sh 
   ansible all -m ping
   ```
